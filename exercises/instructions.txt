Here are instructions for the four folders. Try to get as much done as possible. They do not have to be done in order. Please use d3 version 5.

A. barline folder
Here is a D3 bar line combo chart. I would like you to add the following:
i) Brush window to the barline chart 
Example: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172
The x-axis should only show days and no smaller time unit than that.
ii) Make the default window the last 7 days
iii) Implement brush snapping so only day boundaries are displayed: 
Example: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6232620

B. michigan folder
Here is a county map of Michigan. I would like you to format the text in the tooltip so it only shows the county name. I would also like you to add a click event so that it redirects to another webpage when you click on a county (you can have redirect to the wikipedia page for the county or something).

C. homepage folder
Here is a html file with some bootstrap layout. I would like you to add the county map of Michigan above the list of county names. See png for desired output. The results from task (B) should also be working.

D. donut folder
Here is a D3 donut chart with transition effects. The text transition goes in a straight line which doesn't look good. I would like the text to follow the arc of the circle.
